This directory contains your site's avatar gallery. It has been already prepopulated with some two example galleries: "Nature" and "Space". You can load those to your forum using "loadavatargallery".

Feel free to remove existing galleries or add your own.

If you create gallery named "__default__" and set avatar gallery as default user avatar, Misago will select new users avatars from it while keeping this gallery hidden from existing users.
