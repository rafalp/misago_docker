# This is the cron job that does the scheduled maintenace for Misago.
# It deletes old sessions, refreshes active posters list, prunes categories
# set to delete old threads, keeps read tracking record small, disables
# expired bans, etc. ect.
#
# Tasks defined in this file are ran sequentially, one after the other, making it
# simpler to keep things in order (eg. active posters list is populated after
# users and categories are pruned) and their memory usage is kept in check (no more
# than single maintenance task will be running at single time).
#
# You are free to edit this file to add custom `manage.py` calls for your site.

# Make sure database is available
./.run wait_for_db
