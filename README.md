Misago Docker
=============

**WARNING: This repository is work in progress, don't use it yet!**

This repository aims to provide black-box setup of Misago for people who:

- Want to run their own forum using Misago
- They don't know or don't want to meddle with all Python-specific things like Virtualenv, UWSGI, `misago-start.py` or `settings.py`
- They know enough of Linux to ssh to VPS, navigate around and modify files and follow instructions from guides
- They have half of hour free to setup their VPS using one-click setups like Digital Ocean's Docker Image
- ...but keep the above to necessary minimum if possible


Need help?
