# This is the crontab file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for Misago-Docker
# You are free to customize it by adding additional entries or changing the schedule
# at which the "docker-compose run" is executed, but please keep it in this file.
#
# After updating this file, make sure you load it into cron so its used by your system.
# To do that, simply run this command in directory containing this file:
#
#  crontab cron.txt
#
# Note: if you want to run additional Django management commands, edit `maintenance.sh`
# file located in the misagodocker directory instead!
